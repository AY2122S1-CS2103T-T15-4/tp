### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Command

This command allows the user to add residents or events to the SafeFor(H)All application depending on the currently active tab.

The workflow of the Add command is shown in the Activity diagram illustrated below.

![AddActivityDiagram](images/logic/commands/addcommand/AddActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Optional `LastDate` fields when adding residents** 

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `lastFetDate` and `lastCollectionDate` are optional fields
  * Pros: 
    - Provides more flexibility for users when adding residents to the application, as users have the choice to include or exclude these fields.
    - Saves time as all fields can be added in a single command
  * Cons: The length of command is increased as there are potentially more fields for the user to type.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Add `lastFetDate` and `lastCollectionDate` by editing the Person object
  * Pros: Makes add command more user-friendly as the command is more succinct
  * Cons: User has to go through a two-step process of `add` and `edit` to initialise a residents information 


### Find Command

This command allows searching for residents subjected to 1 or more filters for the different available parameters.

How the parsing works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute the command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. If the command was run in the `ResidentTab` it results in a `FindCommandParser` object created and it's `parse` method called with the user input.
1. The parsing attempts to create a `FindCommand` object. For each existing prefix, it sets the relevant field of a new `FindCompositePredicate` object.
1. Parsing of any of the provided values can throw a `ParseException` if invalid. If at least one field is set, a `FindCommand` object is returned. If all are unspecified, an exception is thrown.
1. The command is executed and the result encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Note:
 - Name can take in multiple keywords separated by whitespace
 - `lastFetDate` and `lastCollectionDate` are not included
 - Room filtering is extended to allow block, level and block-level filtering as well


The following sequence diagram demonstrates what happens when the `FindCommand` is executed:

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/findcommand/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The command extends the `Command` class and implements `FindCommand#execute()` to execute the command.

The crucial logic underlying is encapsulated in the `FindCompositePredicate` class. This class holds the filtering variables and constructs the required predicate for filtering. The `test` method creates and combines the predicates as shown:

```java
@Override
public boolean test(Person person) {
    List<Predicate<Person>> allPredicates = Arrays.asList(
        p -> getName().orElse(x -> true).test(p),
        p -> getRoom().orElse(x -> true).test(p),
        p -> getPhone().orElse(x -> true).test(p.getPhone()),
        p -> getEmail().orElse(x -> true).test(p.getEmail()),
        p -> getVaccStatus().orElse(x -> true).test(p.getVaccStatus()),
        p -> getFaculty().orElse(x -> true).test(p.getFaculty()));

    return allPredicates
            .stream()
            .reduce(p -> true, Predicate::and)
            .test(person);
}
```

Most variables are checked against using it's respective `equals` method except for `Name` and `Room` for which separate predicates implementing `Predicate<Person>` have been created. This is done to support 1. Multiple keywords matching for name and 2. Room matching by block, level and block-level.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Filtering parameters:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Excluding `lastFetDate` and `lastCollectionDate` parameters.
    * Pros:
        - Simpler implementation as there are less filtering predicates to maintain.
        - `list` command exists to enhance the usage of these 2 fields to extract information. A simple equality check on date is less likely from the user's POV and `list` handles this. Thus excluding this, prevents confusion of possible overlapping functionality on the user's side.
    * Cons:
        - The user is unable to search for an exact fet/collection date alongside other filters.

**Aspect: Filtering parameters:**

### Include Command

This command adds multiple residents to an event by referencing the `Event` by its `Index` and the `Person` to add by their `Name` or `Room` through the `AddressBook#findPerson()` method.

The following activity diagram illustrates how the `AddressBook#findPerson()` method works:

![FindPersonActivityDiagram](images/logic/commands/includecommand/FindPersonActivityDiagram.png)

The command extends the `Command` class and implements `IncludeCommand#execute()` to execute the command. A `ResidentList` which contains a list of `Person` to add to an `Event`, is a field added to an `Event`.

When `Event#addResidentsToEvent()` is called, it calls `ResidentList#addResidentList()` to create a new String `newResidents` that consists of current `Person` in the `Event` and append all the `Person` in `toAdd` to this String while making sure that there is no duplicate.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates what happens when the `IncludeCommand` is executed:

![IncludeCommandSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/includecommand/IncludeCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `IncludeCommand` is executed:

![IncludeCommandActivityDiagram](images/logic/commands/includecommand/IncludeCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to reference event in the CLI:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reference by `Index`.
    * Pros: Easy to reference and no need to type out the whole `eventName`, `Index` is also unique.
    * Cons: Need to find the `Index` of the `Event` in the UI to know what `Index` the `Event` has if the number of `Event` is large.

* **Alternative 2:** Reference by `eventName`.
  itself.
    * Pros: Do not need to have the `Index` in UI to know what `Event` it is, can just reference it by its name.
    * Cons: Hard to type when the `eventName` is long, `eventName` not being unique will also cause issues.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
