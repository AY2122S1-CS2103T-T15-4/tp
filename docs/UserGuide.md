## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `view [INDEX]` can be used as `view` or as `view 100.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CCA]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `c/Volleyball`, `c/Frisbee c/Hockey` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME f/FACULTY`, `f/FACULTY n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `v/true v/false` only `v/true` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
